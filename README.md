## Interlock Rochester Time Capsule

Welcome to the Interlock Rochester Time Capsule (IRTC). After 8 years with the hackerspace, we're building a collection of memories from various members (past and present) to be cryptographically locked (See Shamir Secret Sharing) 

## Guidelines:
* Build a compressed archive (e.g. zip or tar) of your various memories you would like include
* Examples would be Images, videos, text, documents, presentations, that remind you of Interlock during a certain time period
* Please limit your files to specific samples of memories -- it should not be an exhaustive archive
* OPTIONAL: Sign your archive with your GPG signature and include a copy of your public key in the request
